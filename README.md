# Privacy Sandbox Demos

A use case demo library for the [Privacy Sandbox APIs](https://privacysandbox.google.com) on the web.

## Motivation

The Privacy Sandbox initiative offers [20+ APIs](https://privacysandbox.google.com) to protect people’s privacy online while giving companies and
developers tools to build thriving digital businesses.

Web ecosystem developers expect new approaches to typical use cases supported today by third-party cookies. These use cases often require
incorporating a combination of new Privacy Sandbox APIs into their products, which requires advanced planning and a clear understanding how these APIs
work.

## Our proposition

The Privacy Sandbox Demos repository offers cookbook recipes, sample code, and demo applications, based on Privacy Sandbox APIs. These are intended to
aid businesses and developers in adapting their applications and the businesses they support to a web ecosystem without third-party cookies.

All the demo code and assets are released under the Apache open-source [license](https://github.com/privacysandbox/privacy-sandbox-demos) to allow you
to extend and modify the code for your own needs.

This repository contains :

- A set of applications/services deployable as container images
- A set of scripts and configuration files for local deployment and cloud deployment
- Documentation :
  - [Instructions for deploying and running the demos in your local environment with Docker](docs/deploy-to-linux-docker.md)
  - [Instructions for deploying and running the demos in your local environment with Podman](docs/deploy-to-linux-podman.md)
  - [Instructions for deploying and running the demos on Google Cloud Platform](docs/deploy-to-gcp.md)
  - [A list of codebase dependencies to prepare for development](docs/dependencies.md)

If you are a developer we recommend you follow the deployment instructions either with [Docker](docs/deploy-to-linux-docker.md) or
[Podman](docs/deploy-to-linux-podman.md).

If you are simply curious, we recommend you have a look at our [Google-hosted instances](https://privacy-sandbox-demos.dev) to quickly start learning
and experimenting.
