 * Where is this script used:
 *   This script is included in Shared Storage Reach Measurement, and is executed

 * What does this script do:
 *
 * This script utilizes the shared storage key "has-reported-content" to identify
 * browsers that have previously contributed to Aggrigations reports for the given contentId.
 *
 * If the browser has NOT previously contributed to the Aggregation report,  the "privateAggregation.contributeToHistogram" functun is called.
