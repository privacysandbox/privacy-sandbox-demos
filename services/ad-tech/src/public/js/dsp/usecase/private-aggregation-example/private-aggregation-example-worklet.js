/**
 * Where is this script used:
 * This script is used to demonstrate passing page context data such as
 * top-level page URL search params into a Shared Storage worklet.
 *
 * What does this script do:
 * This script uses the Private Aggregation API to contribute to the aggregate
 * histogram. This operation allows for local testing by overriding key
 * variables using the page URL, such as bucketKey, bucketValue, scaleFactor,
 * and contextId.
